# The RPC Protocol

The POKT Network protocol first launched on MainNet in July 2020.

A major protocol upgrade, [Shannon](shannon.md), is slated to deploy to MainNet in the summer of 2024.

### [Morse](morse.md)

We built our live protocol (Morse) on top of the [Tendermint framework](https://tendermint.com/) in the Cosmos ecosystem. Over time, we significantly modified the original Tendermint codebase to optimize it for our specific use case.

Since launch, the protocol has served nearly 700 billion relays on over [50 different chains](../../reference/supported-chains.md), using a network of around 15,000 nodes located in 22 countries.

### [Shannon](shannon.md)

All our expertise is going into a major upgrade we've named Shannon, after mathematician and cryptographer Claude Shannon, the father of information theory.

We will deploy Shannon to Celestia's Mocha Testnet in February 2024 and aim to launch it on MainNet by the end of Q2 2024.
