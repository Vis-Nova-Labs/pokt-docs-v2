# CREDS - Governance

We are currently proposing a governance upgraded entitled CREDS in the [forum](https://forum.pokt.network/). The upgrade enfranchises more of our community as DAO Voters based on the principle that governance power is earned through reputation and cannot be bought. This expands on the existing 1-person-1-vote (1P1V) system.



The core of the upgrade is enabling verified credentials to dynamically reflect a Citizenâ€™s reputation in the network such that:

* Contributions to the DAO are recognized via a new set of `BuilderCredentials` (maintaining the existing 1-person-1-vote system, within a Builder House)
* Contributions of productive capital staked in the network are recognized via a new set of `StakerCredentials` (within a new stake-weighted Staker House), which will grant voting power to Nodes, wPOKT LPs, and Gateways

These two Houses are balanced through the HouseWeights parameter, which is set to 80% Builders / 20% Stakers.



Additionally,  Gitcoin Passport is introduced as a Proof of Personhood that reinforces our democratic 1-person-1-vote system and enfranchises anons within the DAO without them needing to be doxxed for voting.&#x20;
