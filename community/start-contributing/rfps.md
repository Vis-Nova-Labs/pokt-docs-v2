# RFPs

### **Overview**&#x20;

**Open RFPs (formerly POPs or Open Priorities)**

Pocket uses RFPs to allocate major projects to our community and other external contributors who can help POKT execute. So far this program has led to teams taking over our testnet, creating snapshots of chain data, building a new browser wallet and an ecosystem dashboard, and updating our website, plus more to be announced soon.

Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are found [here](https://forum.pokt.network/c/build/pop/120) on our forum.

### **RFPs - Specifics**

Each RFP includes:

1. **Requirements:** _the objective and requirements, plus details needed from submissions._
2. **Submission period:** _period during which submissions will be accepted._
3. **Review period:** _time during which PNF (or the DAO) will review submissions and report its decision and reasoning._

Examples of successful submissions and processes include:

[Website Rebuild](https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-website-rebuild/4711?u=adrienne): delivered by [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/)

[Metrics Dashboard](https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-pocket-network-ecosystem-metrics-dashboard/4594?u=adrienne): delivered by [TogetherCrew](https://www.togethercrew.com/)

We are also creating a mechanism for bottom-up RFPs to be put out for tender by the community itself. We will share more detail on this soon.
