# Migration of Existing Voters

In addition to supporting new user onboarding, we have our existing DAO Voter cohort to migrate to the new system. OG DAO voters have two ways to claim their vote.

## Option #1: Anonymous claim&#x20;

OG DAO Voters who would like to remain anonymous have to go through the following steps:

1. Enter the Discord channel \[Name] and complete the [citizenship quests](onboarding-new-voters.md#new-citizens).
2. Navigate to[ mygateway.xyz](http://mygateway.xyz) dashboard and log into your account.
3.  Once you have logged in to your account, at the bottom left click on your Gateway username and then click on `Manage Gateway ID`

4.  Scroll down and click on `+ Add Wallet`

5. Connect the EVM wallet that holds your original DAO Voter NFT. To be clear, you need to connect the same wallet address as previously used for voting to your[ mygateway.xyz](http://mygateway.xyz) profile.
6. Once you have ensured your wallet is connected, the system will automatically issue your PDA within the next 24 hours.

## Option #2: Doxxed claim

OG DAO Voters will be grandfathered into the new governance system. For those who are happy to be doxxed to the PNF team, you need to:

1. Enter the Discord channel \[Name] and complete the Set up Quest using Wonderverse. This includes ensuring you set up & verify a Gitcoin Passport, Gateway.xyz Username and the Eth Voter Wallet you intend to use
2. Contact Ben or Mehrdad on Discord so we can verify and issue your OG voter credentials to the chosen ETH wallet.

OG Voters who complete these steps will automatically become citizens.  Please note that this path does not require completing the Citizen quests and is a faster migration path for any OG Voters who are less concerned to be doxxed (and only doxxed to the PNF team)
