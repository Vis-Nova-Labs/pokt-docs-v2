# Support & FAQ

The Pocket Network Foundation will administer the program on behalf of the POKT DAO. &#x20;

Pocket Network Foundation will assess projects before they entering the voting pool. Any project that violates the Applicant Guidelines will be removed during this assessment procedure.&#x20;

Conflicts of interest between applicants and voters must be declared during the application process. Voters will be required to abstain from voting for projects where they are a direct applicant, are employed by the applicant company or projects, or for any applicants they have a direct equity investment in. This will be further described in the Voter Guidelines and overseen by a Conflicts Committee.

Further detail will be provided here in an FAQ as required. If support is needed please raise a ticket in the POKT Discord&#x20;
