# Governance



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Modular Governance.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Our Governance is based on participation, 1 person 1 vote. Gini coefficient of 0 (perfect equality).

We may well be the only revenue generating protocol not to be dominated by governance whales.

Today we are building on that strength to roll out a modular approach to governance that will enable us to:

* close gaps in representation
* reduce friction in claiming your vote
* recognise differences in our different stakeholder groups

To dig into the details, take a look at our [Lean Governance Thesis](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/The%20Lean%20Governance%20Thesis.pdf).

### Current System

To learn how to earn a vote in the DAO and decide the future of Pocket Network, [see the section on trophies](../../govern/get-trophies/).

{% hint style="info" %}
You donâ€™t need a vote in the DAO to submit proposals or participate in discussions! Everyone is free to share their opinions. Head over to [the forum](https://forum.pokt.network/) to see what decisions are being debated.
{% endhint %}

### CREDs - 3d Governance

Our governance needs have evolved as the DAO has evolved, so we went back to the drawing board to create a governance model for POKT in 2024.

There is an active proposal for upgrading our governance, taking into account the many contributors who don't have a DAO vote.

Follow along here:\

We expect to have the proposal pass in early April and the system fully only by the end of the month, bringing in many new voters and fresh perspectives.
