# The RPC Protocol

POKT Network's protocol first launched on MainNet in July 2020.

A major protocol upgrade, [Shannon](shannon.md), is targeted to deploy to MainNet summer of 2024.

### [Morse](morse.md)

We built our live Protocol (Morse) on top of the Tendermint framework within the Cosmos ecosystem. Since then, we have significantly modified  the original Tendermint codebase to to be optimized for our specific use case.

Since its launch, this protocol has severed nearly 700 billion relays on over 50 different chains, using a network of around 15,000 nodes located in 22 countries.

### [Shannon](shannon.md)

All our expertise is going into a significant upgrade we've named Shannon, after Claude Shannon, the founding figure of information theory.

We will deploy Shannon to Celestia's Mocha Testnet in February 2024 and aim to launch it on MainNet by the end of Q2 2024.
