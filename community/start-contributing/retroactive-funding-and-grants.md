# Retroactive Funding & Grants

Retroactive funding complements upfront payment mechanisms by enabling the community to reward activity or projects that have generated the most impact. It can serve as a regular and predictable mechanism for public goods funding and inspire the “ecosystem goods” and value-driven behavior we want to see in our open-source community.

The first round of retroactive funding will roll out in May 2024. Details on how it will work are being finalized. Keep an eye on the related [forum thread](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pep-72-retroactive-pokt-goods-funding-rpgf/5187) or our twitter account for updates.
