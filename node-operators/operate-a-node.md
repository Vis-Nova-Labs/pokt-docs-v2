# Operate a Node

## **The Easy Ways**

The easiest way to deploy your node is to use a 3rd party Pocket Project Node Pilot, a free tool that was custom built for Pocket Network.

Node Pilot provides an intuitive user interface to set up and manage Pocket and relay chain nodes.

You can access Node Pilot [here](https://nodepilot.tech/).
