# RFPs

### **Overview**&#x20;

**Open RFPs (formerly POPs or Open Priorities)**

Pocket uses RFPs to allocate out major work to our community and other external contributors who can help POKT execute. So far this program has led to teams taking over our testnet, creating snapshots of chain data, building a new browser wallet, an ecosystem dashboard, updating our website with more to be announced soon.

Requests for Proposals (RFPs) can be found on our forum and are always posted [here](https://forum.pokt.network/c/build/pop/120)

Each RFP will include:

1. **Requirements:** _the objective and requirements, plus details needed from submissions._
2. **Submission period:** _period during which submissions can and will be accepted._
3. **Review period:** _time during which PNF (or the DAO) will review submissions and report on decisions and reasoning._

Illustrative examples of good submissions and processes include:

[Website Rebuild](https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-website-rebuild/4711?u=adrienne): delivered by [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/)

[Metrics Dashboard](https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-pocket-network-ecosystem-metrics-dashboard/4594?u=adrienne): delivered by [TogetherCrew](https://www.togethercrew.com/)

We are also creating a mechanism for bottom up RFPs to be surfaced by the community itself. We will share more detail on this soon.
