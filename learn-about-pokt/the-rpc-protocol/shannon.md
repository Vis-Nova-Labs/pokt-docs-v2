### About Shannon&#x20;

Shannon is the next major upgrade to the Pocket Network Protocol.&#x20;



### History of Shannon&#x20;

In early August, the POKT Network (or Pocket Network) core protocol team made a crucial decision: we temporarily halted all development on the upcoming version of the POKT Protocol: the Shannon upgrade (formerly referred to as v1). We embarked on a 3-week intensive research sprint to evaluate rapid advancements of other projects in the industry and ensure an optimal path forward.

Our research period was a mix of open exploration, daily research syncs lasting 1-2 hours throughout the whole period, in-person discussions at a three-day offsite, extensive deep dives into at least nine projects that particularly caught our attention, calls with core teams from many of these projects, input from industry experts, and the development of several Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) along the way.

To get to the punch line, we’re going to implement the Shannon upgrade as a micro-rollup using [Rollkit](http://web.archive.org/web/20231006003924/https://rollkit.dev/)’s modular framework that features [Celestia](http://web.archive.org/web/20231006003924/https://celestia.org/) as the Data Availability (DA) layer.
