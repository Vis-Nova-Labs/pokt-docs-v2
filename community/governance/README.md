# Governance



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Modular Governance.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Our Governance is based on participation, 1 person 1 vote. Gini coefficient of 0 (perfect equality).

We may well be the only revenue generating protocol not to be dominated by governance whales.

Today we are building on that strength to roll out a modular approach to governance that will enable us to:

* close gaps in representation
* reduce friction in claiming your vote
* recognise differences in our different stakeholder groups

To dig into the details, take a look at our [Lean Governance Thesis](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/The%20Lean%20Governance%20Thesis.pdf).

### Current System

To learn how to earn a vote in the DAO and decide the future of Pocket Network, [see the section on trophies](../../govern/get-trophies/).

{% hint style="info" %}
You don’t need a vote in the DAO to submit proposals or participate in discussions! Everyone is free to share their opinions. Head over to [the forum](https://forum.pokt.network/) to see what decisions are being debated.
{% endhint %}

### Modular Governance

We're rolling out our latest upgrade in modules.

We expect to have all modules shared, approved and implemented by mid-December.

Watch this space. We’ll bring it all home by Christmas. :christmas\_tree:
