# Bounties

### **Overview**

Bounties are tasks that meet specific Pocket Network needs. They can be scoped by the Foundation, the Protocol Team, the DAO, or anyone working on POKT projects.

These tasks are great for newcomers to Pocket Network to show Proof of Impact in the community. We see them as paths to more opportunities. You can start with small tasks, use what you learn to get a grant for your ideas, and eventually become a core contributor being funded from the DAO.

Inspired by [Dework](https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/fundamentals/task-types-and-assignee-gating), we'll manage our grants directly in Discord to keep things simple and avoid the hassle of using another tool. If this method gets too complicated, we'll consider using external tools for managing tasks.

Some of you may recall [IDEAS](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pep-41-identify-efficiencies-and-suggestions-ideas/3396). As a continued effort, if individuals or teams want to request bounties, please fill in the required template under the pinned IDEAS/SUGGESTIONS topic. The Foundation will review & work with the community to determine if this is a good spend for the DAO, and then open it up as a bounty to the community.&#x20;

### **Bounty Details**

#### Bounty Types

There are different types of bounties:

* Assigned
  * Used to assign a bounty directly to a contributor; typically discussed in another forum but useful for payment + tracking publicly.
* Open to Applications
  * All contributors will have to apply to the task before they can be assigned to it, and whoever has opened the bounty will be responsible for reviewing and assigning. There can be one or multiple winners.
* Multiple Submissions
  * With this option any contributor can directly submit work without having to apply first or hold any specific role to get access. The person who opens the bounty should define if there will be one or multiple winners.

#### **Bounty Status**

An OPEN bounty means anyone can submit either an application or deliverable.\
The person who opened the bounty will always be responsible for approving and payment of the bounty.

An UNDER REVIEW bounty means that submissions are closed and the review is in progress.

A CLOSED bounty is locked and sticking around for transparency.

#### **Bounty Submission**

All materials must be delivered within the bounty board post, or linked to if applicable (e.g. a Google Drive folder, a URL, a Notion page).

Submissions must meet all requirements, or they’ll be automatically disqualified. All requirements should be CLEARLY LABELED and easily identified.

#### **Bounty Payments**

Bounty payments are targeted for Mondays, within 10 days of bounty approval. As they're made manually by a Foundation team that works all over the globe, the payments might run a day or two late.&#x20;

**Bounty Eligibility**

Currently bounties are open to anyone. In the future we’re going to play with the mechanism that requires citizenship, but for now bounties are a great place to get started with minimal barrier to entry.
