# Manual Node Setup Guide

### Who is this guide for? <a href="#who-is-this-guide-for" id="who-is-this-guide-for"></a>

This guide is for anyone interested in running Pocket nodes. While the goal is to keep things simple, the assumption is that you have some general blockchain and computer networking knowledge, and some Linux terminal experience. &#x20;

### Background&#x20;

The main utility of a Pocket node is to relay transactions to other blockchains. So, Pocket nodes need access to other nodes for the blockchains they’ll be relaying to. However, the focus of this guide is solely the setup of a Pocket node that will relay to the Pocket blockchain, essentially, through itself. **Setting up nodes for other blockchains such as Harmony, Ethereum, or any of the other** [**supported blockchains**](../../reference/supported-chains.md) **is beyond the scope of this guide.**

### What you’ll need <a href="#what-youll-need" id="what-youll-need"></a>

To complete the steps in this guide for Pocket node setup, you’ll need:

1. A server connected to the internet with the following minimum hardware requirements: 4 CPUs, 16 GB RAM, 1.5 TB Disk
2. A domain name
3. The ability to add DNS records for your domain
4. At least 15,001 POKT for staking
5. About 2-4 hours to complete and test everything
