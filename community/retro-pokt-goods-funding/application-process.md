## Applicants Guideline&#x20;

You are only evaluated based on the impact you have already created. Do not mention or allude to your future work or future impact. This is retroactive funding, not proactive funding!

Every type of developer and contributor is eligible for RetroPGF. It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that POKT pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that POKT love or your actions in the DAO or forums.&#x20;

2. **False statements & deception** - false claims about your contributions, past impact or funding & grants are not allowed.
