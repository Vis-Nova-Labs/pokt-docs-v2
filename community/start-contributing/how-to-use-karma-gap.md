# How to Use Karma GAP

## Guide to Karma GAP

We use Karma GAP (Grantee Accountability Protocol) to track work and measure impact of Quick Grants and to administer Maintainer roles.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Once your Quick Grant or Maintainer role has been approved in the POKT forum, you’ll have to add the information on your grant or role to the POKT Community section in the Karma GAP (Karma) application. You’ll need a tiny amount of ETH to pay for set-up on the Optimism network (typically under $0.50 per transaction).

Log in to the [Karma application](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/) with the ETH wallet where you’ll be receiving payment.

**Set up a project**. A project title and description are required. To save the information and create your project, you’ll need to approve a blockchain transaction and pay the transaction fee.

**Create a new grant**. From your project page, navigate to the “Grants” tab. You will see a button to “Add grant”; click it. In the form to add a grant, there is a community drop-down menu; select POKT.

You’ll have to give your grant a title, description and start date. You can choose to enter the amount of your grant and a link to the related proposal in the POKT forum. For the description, please begin with a one-sentence summary followed by details of the planned work and grant objectives.

As there’s no option in Karma to create a Maintainer role, you’ll need to set it up as a grant.

There are spaces for provision of impact criteria and other data listed below. While Karma notes all of this information as optional, your answers to the first three questions are needed for PNF’s monthly reviews of your grant:

1. How should the success of your grant be measured?
2. What is the intended direct impact of your project on the ecosystem? (Clearly describe how this grant supports our [2024 ambitions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forum.pokt.network/t/pnf-ecosystem-strategy-and-ambitions-update/4836\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1713496410018252\&usg=AOvVaw2dV5xyZz4I4x-V4FilDpRG)).
3. What is the long-term impact of your grant?
4. How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation in the ecosystem?
5. How will the grant funds be used?
6. What is the timeframe for the work funded?

Information on your grant can be copy/pasted from your proposal in the forum.

Provision of the requested information is required also for eligibility for Governance, retroPGF, and continued grant support, so please be thorough!

Once you’ve filled in the desired information, click “Save” to create your grant. This triggers a blockchain interaction transaction and fee.

On the same page where you create your grant, there’s an option - before you create the grant - to add a milestone. A title is required; a description and start and finish dates are optional.

Once you’ve created your grant, you can modify it by clicking on “Edit Grant.” To change a milestone that’s already been posted, you’ll have to delete and repost (there’s no option to edit). Editing and deleting incur transaction fees.

For a great example of how to set up a project and grant, see the [Develop DAO project](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/simplify-infrastructure-deployments-and-operations) and its Simplify Infrastructure Deployments and Operations grant.

### PNF Can Do Initial Setup

As PNF has admin control, you could request it to set up your grant or Maintainer role on Karma with bare-bones information using the ETH address noted in your grant or Maintainer role application.

You would then claim your grant by logging in with the same ETH address. Click “My Project” in the header, then in the left sidebar select the grant. Next, using the “Edit Grant” function beside your grant, flesh out your grant description, and add any non-mandatory detail and milestone.

(Although created for Arbitrum, it's the same process you’ll need to follow.)

### Monthly Impact Updates

At the end of every month, you’ll need to self-report on Karma. You’ll do this under “Grant Update” - or if it applies, under “Milestones and Updates.”

When you post your update, make sure to evaluate your work against the impact criteria (or relevant milestone) you established for your grant. Impact is what you will be graded on; it will determine if your Quick Grant remains open.

### Web 3 Reputation Buildup

By making details of your work public along with its impact and others’ assessment, Karma enables grantees to build reputation across Web 3.
