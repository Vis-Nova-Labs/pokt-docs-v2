### About Shannon&#x20;

Shannon is the next major upgrade to the Pocket Network Protocol.&#x20;

### History of Shannon&#x20;

Early in August, the POKT Network's main team paused work on the next POKT Protocol version, known as the Shannon upgrade. We spent three weeks looking closely at the latest developments in our field to choose the best way forward.

During our research, we did a lot of exploring, met every day for 1-2 hours of updates, had in-depth discussions at a three-day meeting away from the office, examined at least nine projects that caught our eye closely, talked to the teams behind these projects, received guidance from experts in our field, and worked on several test projects to see how our ideas would work in practice.

To get to the punch line, we’re going to implement the Shannon upgrade as a micro-rollup using [Rollkit](http://web.archive.org/web/20231006003924/https://rollkit.dev/)’s modular framework that features [Celestia](http://web.archive.org/web/20231006003924/https://celestia.org/) as the Data Availability (DA) layer.
